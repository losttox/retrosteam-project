RetroSteam is a text-based game store simulation inspired by Steam, built in C++. It provides users with a nostalgic command-line interface where they can browse, purchase, and manage their game collection. The project replicates the essence of early digital game distribution platforms, offering a structured shopping experience entirely through text-based commands and ASCII visuals.

Users can log in, purchase games, buy gift cards, subscribe to services, and enjoy an interactive ASCII-art outro. RetroSteam is a lightweight alternative to modern game stores, perfect for those who appreciate retro-style interfaces.
